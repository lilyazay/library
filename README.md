# library
Library Group Project for SWE 3313 (Group 9)

This library app is meant to function as a transactional day-to-day data entry system for book movement within a library.
The system will be able to be used by students for checking-in and checking-out, searching for books, reports on books they have, etc.
The system will also be able to be used by librarians to generate reports on books currently checked-out, as well as new books being shelved. 

Data included (thus far; list will be updated as needed):
1.	Books (author, subject, title, ISBN, shelving code, publisher, language)
2.	Shelves (code, location, capacity)
3.	Students (student ID, name)
